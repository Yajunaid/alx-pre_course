My first readme
This is my first readme as you can see from the tittle,
this readme gives me so many error before I can create it
using CLI.
alx_SE have taught me a lot I thank the founder of this program,
the management and all the team members, our mentors and my fellow student.
I am commiting my maximum time for this program which is worth it.
Finally I pray to scale through the end.
